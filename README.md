## Project setup

Go to the root directory of Project

for docker build

```bash
  docker-compose build
```

```bash
  docker-compose up -d
```

After that there is script file for data seeding.

```bash
  bash "prisma-script.sh" 
```

And then if you go to localhost:3000, you will see the project is running.

Please let me know if you got some issues running the project.
